# Graph consists of a finite set of vertices or nodes and a set of edges which connect a pair of nodes.

# Vertices - Vertices are the nodes of the graph.
#Edge - The Edge is the line that connect pair of vertices.
#Unweighted Graph - A Graph which does not have a weight associated with any graph.
#Weighted Graph - A Graph which has a weight associated with any edge.
#Undirected Graph - In case the edges of the graph do not have a direction associated with them.
#Directed Graph - If the edges has a direction associated with them.
#Cyclic Graph - A Graph which has at least one loop.
# Acyclic Graph - A Graph with no loop
# Tree - It is a special case of directed Acyclic graph.

# We can represent Graph in two ways - 
# 1. Adjacency Matrix - It is stored in a 2D Matrix.
# 2. Adjacency List - It is stored in the form of a Linked List , where the nodes are stored in the form of the list , while the edges are stored to the respective nodes.
